# Stock Valuation System

## Overview

The Stock Valuation System provides comprehensive inventory valuation capabilities using multiple costing methods. This system enables accurate financial reporting, cost analysis, and inventory management for businesses operating in Morocco and internationally.

## Features

### Supported Valuation Methods

#### 1. Weighted Average Cost (WAC)
- **Description**: Calculates average cost of all units in inventory
- **Formula**: Total Cost of Goods Available ÷ Total Units Available
- **Best For**: Stable pricing environments, general inventory
- **Advantages**: Smooths out price fluctuations, simple to understand
- **Disadvantages**: May not reflect current market conditions

#### 2. First In, First Out (FIFO)
- **Description**: Assumes first purchased items are sold first
- **Implementation**: Uses cost layers to track individual purchase costs
- **Best For**: Perishable goods, inflationary environments
- **Advantages**: Reflects current market value, matches physical flow
- **Disadvantages**: More complex tracking, higher administrative costs

#### 3. Last In, First Out (LIFO)
- **Description**: Assumes last purchased items are sold first
- **Implementation**: Uses cost layers in reverse chronological order
- **Best For**: Non-perishable goods, deflationary environments
- **Advantages**: Matches current costs with revenues
- **Disadvantages**: May not reflect physical flow, complex tracking

#### 4. Standard Cost
- **Description**: Uses predetermined standard costs
- **Implementation**: Fixed cost per unit regardless of actual purchase price
- **Best For**: Manufacturing environments, budgeting and planning
- **Advantages**: Simplifies costing, enables variance analysis
- **Disadvantages**: Requires regular updates, may not reflect actual costs

#### 5. Moving Average
- **Description**: Continuously updated average cost
- **Implementation**: Recalculates average after each transaction
- **Best For**: High-volume, frequent transactions
- **Advantages**: Always current, responsive to price changes
- **Disadvantages**: Requires real-time processing, complex calculations

5. **Maintain Layers**: Update cost layers for FIFO/LIFO methods

### Stock Move Processing

#### Incoming Moves (Purchases, Production)
1. Create new cost layers (FIFO/LIFO methods)
2. Update weighted average calculations
3. Record valuation changes
4. Update standard costs (if configured)

#### Outgoing Moves (Sales, Consumption)
1. Consume cost layers in method-specific order
2. Calculate cost of goods sold
3. Update remaining inventory values
4. Record valuation impacts

#### Internal Moves (Transfers)
1. Process as outgoing from source location
2. Process as incoming to destination location
3. Maintain cost consistency across locations
4. Update location-specific valuations

### Revaluation Process

#### Automatic Revaluation
- **Scheduled Execution**: Daily, weekly, monthly, or quarterly
- **Trigger Conditions**: Cost variance thresholds, time intervals
- **Scope**: Full inventory or specific products/warehouses
- **Notification**: Alerts for significant valuation changes

#### Manual Revaluation
- **On-Demand**: User-initiated revaluation
- **Selective**: Specific products, categories, or locations
- **Method Changes**: Apply new valuation methods
- **Audit Trail**: Complete record of revaluation activities
